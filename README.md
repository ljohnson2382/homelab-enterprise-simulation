# Multi-Platform Homelab Infrastructure

> **Virtualized Learning Environment for Enterprise Technology Experience**

A comprehensive self-directed technical lab built to gain hands-on experience with Linux administration, Windows Server management, and cybersecurity testing. This homelab demonstrates practical implementation of enterprise security practices and multi-platform system administration.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Learning Philosophy
This homelab represents my commitment to understanding enterprise technologies beyond my current support role. By gaining hands-on experience with security hardening, server administration, and multi-platform environments, I'm building practical knowledge that enhances my ability to troubleshoot and support complex IT infrastructure.

### Learning Objective
Develop comprehensive technical understanding that allows me to provide better support and grow into more advanced IT roles with confidence and competency.

### Strategic Deployment Decisions
While initially considering self-hosting portfolio content from the Ubuntu server, I strategically chose enterprise cloud deployment (Azure Static Web Apps) to gain experience with modern DevOps practices and enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines - demonstrating practical business decision-making in technology choices.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Architecture

## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### Linux Server Security Hardening
- **SSH Hardening**: Key-based authentication with password authentication completely disabled
- **Access Control**: Root login disabled, sudo-only administration enforced
- **Network Security**: Custom SSH port configuration, firewall hardening with only essential ports open
- **Stealth Configuration**: ICMP ping disabled for operational security
- **Service Minimization**: Minimal attack surface with only essential services (MariaDB) running
- **Automatic Updates**: Configured for security patch management

### System Administration Practices
- **Security-First Approach**: Every configuration decision prioritizes security
- **Minimal Service Footprint**: Only necessary services enabled to reduce attack surface
- **Secure File Transfers**: SCP-based file management for secure operations
- **Command-Line Proficiency**: Full server management via secure shell access
